# Overview

```{r}

data("volunt")
```


The `volunt` dataset contains data from `r nrow(volunt)` people on volunteering.

The dataset contains:

- `id`: identifier for each person
- `age`: age of the participants in years
- `ses`: socioeconomic status, from 1 (low) to 4 (high)
- `sconnection`: a scale measuring the social connection within the community. From 1 (low) to 10 (high)
- `vol`: is the person involved in volunteering? 1 = yes, 0 = no

# Steps

1. Import the data
2. Explore the dataset
    - univariate distributions of the variables
    - bivariate relationships
3. fit a model testing all main effects and interpret the parameters
4. fit a model testing the interaction between ses and social connection. Compare the model with the previous model and interpret the result.
