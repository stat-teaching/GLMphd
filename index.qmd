# Course

This repository contains the materials for the course *Generalized Linear Models* from the PhD program in Psychological Sciences (University of Padova). The repository is organized as an R Package.

## Getting Started

To start with the course you can download or clone the entire Git repository. Simply run `git clone link` or follow this link.

Then you can open the `GLMphd.Rproj` file and R Studio will be opened on the correct folder. From now, everything is organized as a package. To load all the custom function of the `R` folder and datasets (`data` folder) you can use `devtools::load_all()`. This is the same as doing `source("file.R")` without cluttering the global environment.
