\title{Simulate experimental design data}
\usage{
sim_design(n, within = NULL, between = NULL, covariates = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. Number of subjects (or experimental units).}

\item{within}{Optional. A named list of within-subject factors and their
levels, e.g. \code{list(time = c("t1", "t2"))}.}

\item{between}{Optional. A named list of between-subject factors and their
levels, e.g. \code{list(group = c("A", "B"))}.}

\item{covariates}{Optional. A named list of covariates to simulate. Each
element should be a specification accepted by \code{\link[=sim_n_x]{sim_n_x()}} (not included here).}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{id}: Subject identifier.
\item Columns for within-subject factors (if any).
\item Columns for between-subject factors (if any).
\item Columns for simulated covariates (if any).
}
}
\description{
Generates a dataset representing a factorial experimental design with
optional within-subject factors, between-subject factors, and covariates.
Useful for creating synthetic data structures for simulations.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item At least one of \code{within}, \code{between}, or \code{covariates} must be provided.
\item Within-subject factors are fully crossed using \code{\link[=expand.grid]{expand.grid()}}.
\item Between-subject factors are merged with within-subject factors to create
all combinations.
\item Covariates are simulated per subject using \code{sim_n_x()}.
}
}
\examples{
# Only between-subject factor
sim_design(n = 4, between = list(group = c("A", "B")))

# Within and between
sim_design(
  n = 2,
  within = list(time = c("t1", "t2")),
  between = list(group = c("A", "B"))
)

# With covariates (assuming [`sim_n_x`] is defined)
# sim_design(n = 5, between = list(group = c("A","B")),
#            covariates = list(age = "rnorm"))

}
