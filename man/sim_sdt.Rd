\title{Simulate a Signal Detection Theory (SDT) experiment}
\usage{
sim_sdt(n, d = 0, c = 0, p.signal = 0.5, vr = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. Total number of trials.}

\item{d}{Numeric. Sensitivity (\eqn{d'}) of the participant, representing
the standardized separation between the signal and noise distributions.}

\item{c}{Numeric. Decision criterion (\eqn{c}). A positive \code{c} means a conservative
criterion (biased towards responding "noise"), while a negative \code{c} means a liberal
criterion (biased towards responding "signal").}

\item{p.signal}{Numeric. Probability that a trial contains a signal
(between 0 and 1).}

\item{vr}{Numeric. Standard deviation of the signal distribution.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\describe{
\item{say_signal}{Participant response (1 = "signal", 0 = "noise").}
\item{is_signal}{True trial type (1 = signal, 0 = noise).}
\item{x}{Internal decision variable sampled from the noise or signal distribution.}
}
}
\description{
Generates simulated data for a basic Signal Detection Theory (SDT) experiment,
where each trial contains either a signal or noise, and the participant
responds based on a decision criterion.
}
\details{
This function implements a standard SDT model:

\deqn{x \sim \mathcal{N}(-d/2, 1), \quad \text{if trial is noise}}
\deqn{x \sim \mathcal{N}(d/2, vr^2), \quad \text{if trial is signal}}

The participant responds "signal" if the internal decision variable exceeds
the decision criterion:

\deqn{\text{say\_signal} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } x > c \\
0 & \text{if } x \le c
\end{cases}}

The criterion \code{c} reflects response bias:
\itemize{
\item \code{c > 0}: conservative, more likely to respond "noise"
\item \code{c < 0}: liberal, more likely to respond "signal"
}

Sensitivity \code{d} (d-prime) represents the distance between the means of
the signal and noise distributions in standard deviation units.

# Simulate 100 trials with moderate sensitivity and neutral criterion
